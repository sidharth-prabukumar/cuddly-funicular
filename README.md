OpenGL Renderer with Texture Manipulation and Test Frameworks

This OpenGL project is a work in progress where I create and learn more features for textures and objects rendering and 
tests to go with that.

--Currently, I have created and abstracted the Vertex Buffer Object, Vertex Array Object, Index Buffer Object and a vertex and fragment 
shader designed for texture rendering.

--I have also integrated this with imgui interface and added Color and texture test frameworks.
