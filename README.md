OpenGL Texture Manipulation and Test Code Base
This OpenGL code base is a learning project work in progress as I create and learn more features for textures and objects rendering and 
tests to go with that.

--Currently, I have created and abstracted the Vertex Buffer Object, Vertex Array Object, Index Buffer Object and a vertex and fragment 
shader designed for texture rendering.

--I have also integrated this with imgui and added Clear Color and texture test frameworks, which are also abstracted in the "Test" section.
